/**
 * Vendored from Ollie (apps/native/src/modules/grocery/aging.ts) on 2026-06-11.
 * Pantry aging state machine.
 *
 * Pure module — no React, no IO, no clock. Caller passes `nowMs` so tests
 * can exercise every boundary deterministically.
 *
 * Product rule (locked 2026-05-30):
 *   - `shelfLifeDays × 1.0` — visually faded (still on the list, dim ink).
 *   - `shelfLifeDays × 1.5` — a quiet "still here?" affordance appears.
 *   - `shelfLifeDays × 2.0` — the row auto-archives (out of the active list).
 *   - shelfLifeDays === null → 'fresh' forever (we don't know the item, so
 *     pretending we do would surface false signals; silence wins).
 *
 * NOT a streak system. NOT a countdown. Visual aging only — ADHD-safe.
 *
 * Boundaries are half-open intervals on `elapsed = nowMs − addedAtMs`,
 * converted to days. The shape:
 *
 *   elapsed < 1.0 × shelf      → fresh
 *   1.0 × shelf ≤ … < 1.5 ×    → faded
 *   1.5 × shelf ≤ … < 2.0 ×    → still_here_prompt
 *   2.0 × shelf ≤ …            → should_archive
 *
 * A row at exactly the boundary (e.g. elapsed === 1.5 × shelf) graduates
 * to the *next* state, matching the "as soon as it's been 1.5×, ask" intent.
